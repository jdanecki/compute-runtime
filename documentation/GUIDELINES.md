File to cover guidelines for NEO project.

# C++ usage

* use c++ style casts instead of c style casts.
* do not use default parameters
* prefer using over typedef
* avoid defines for constants, use constexpr
* prefer forward declarations in headers
* avoid includes in headers unless absolutely necessary

# Naming conventions

* use camelCase for variables names
* prefer verbose variable names
```
bad examples : sld, elws, aws
good examples : sourceLevelDebugger, enqueuedLocalWorkGroupSize, actualWorkGroupSize
```
* follow givenWhenThen test naming pattern, indicate what is interesting in the test

bad examples :
```
TEST(CsrTests, initialize)
TEST(CQTests, simple)
TEST(CQTests, basic)
TEST(CQTests, works)
```
good examples:
```
TEST(CommandStreamReceiverTests, givenCommandStreamReceiverWhenItIsInitializedThenProperFieldsAreSet)
TEST(CommandQueueTests, givenCommandQueueWhenEnqueueIsDoneThenTaskLevelIsModifed)
TEST(CommandQueueTests, givenCommandQueueWithDefaultParamtersWhenEnqueueIsDoneThenTaskCountIncreases)
TEST(CommandQueueTests, givenCommandQueueWhenEnqueueWithBlockingFlagIsSetThenDriverWaitsUntilAllCommandsAreCompleted)
```
# Testing mindset

* Test behaviors instead of implementations, do not focus on adding a test per every function in the 
class (avoid tests for setters and getters), focus on the functionality you are adding and how it changes
the driver behavior, do not bind tests to implementation.
* Make sure that test is fast, our test suite needs to complete in seconds for efficient development pace, as 
a general rule test shouldn't be longer then 1ms in Debug driver.
